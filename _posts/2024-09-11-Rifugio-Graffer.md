# Graffer Hut at Grostè

The project focuses on the revitalization and expansion of the historic Giorgio Graffer Refuge in the Dolomites of Brenta. The design aims to address structural and organizational issues by integrating a new volume to enhance the refuge's functionality. Key improvements include upgrading vertical circulation, reorganizing the kitchen and dining areas to increase capacity by 60 seats, and modernizing common sanitary facilities. The competition considers only the reorganization of the ground floor and its connection to the new expansion.
